I. DESCRIPTION

  Net::TCLink is a thin client library to allow your e-commerce servers to
connect to the TrustCommerce payment gateway easily and consistently.
The protocol (which is the same across all platforms and languages) is
well-documented in the Web Developer's Guide, so please consult it for
any questions you may have about the protocol syntax itself.

  If you are using Perl or ActivePerl on Win32, please download
the COM object from the Vault website.


II. INSTALLATION

  You will need the OpenSSL libraries and header files installed on your 
system to compile Net::TCLink.  You can download them from 
http://www.openssl.org.  Many modern UNIX systems (including Red Hat 
Linux 7.0 and above) come with the OpenSSL libraries pre-installed.

  The installation should need only the following steps.

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make install


III. USAGE

  The included perl script 'test.pl' shows how easy it is to use
the Net::TCLink Perl module.

	The Net::TCLink is very easy to use.  It consists of a single function 
call "send()" that take a hash or a hash reference as it's only parameter.  
The hash must contain name/value pairs required to run transactions through 
the TrustCommerce gateway.  The return value is a hash of values describing the
status of the transaction. Please refer to the TCDevGuide.txt or 
TCDevGuide.html in the doc folder for more information.
